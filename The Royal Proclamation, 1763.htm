<H1 align=center>The Royal Proclamation</H1>
<P align=center>October 7, 1763 
<P>BY THE KING. A PROCLAMATION<BR>GEORGE R. 
<P>Whereas We have taken into Our Royal Consideration the extensive and valuable 
Acquisitions in America, secured to our Crown by the late Definitive Treaty of 
Peace, concluded at Paris. the 10th Day of February last; and being desirous 
that all Our loving Subjects, as well of our Kingdom as of our Colonies in 
America, may avail themselves with all convenient Speed, of the great Benefits 
and Advantages which must accrue therefrom to their Commerce, Manufactures, and 
Navigation, We have thought fit, with the Advice of our Privy Council. to issue 
this our Royal Proclamation, hereby to publish and declare to all our loving 
Subjects, that we have, with the Advice of our Said Privy Council, granted our 
Letters Patent, under our Great Seal of Great Britain, to erect, within the 
Countries and Islands ceded and confirmed to Us by the said Treaty, Four 
distinct and separate Governments, styled and called by the names of Quebec, 
East Florida, West Florida and Grenada, and limited and bounded as follows, viz. 

<P>First--The Government of Quebec bounded on the Labrador Coast by the River 
St. John, and from thence by a Line drawn from the Head of that River through 
the Lake St. John, to the South end of the Lake Nipissim; from whence the said 
Line, crossing the River St. Lawrence, and the Lake Champlain, in 45. Degrees of 
North Latitude, passes along the High Lands which divide the Rivers that empty 
themselves into the said River St. Lawrence from those which fall into the Sea; 
and also along the North Coast of the Baye des Chaleurs, and the Coast of the 
Gulph of St. Lawrence to Cape Rosieres, and from thence crossing the Mouth of 
the River St. Lawrence by the West End of the Island of Anticosti, terminates at 
the aforesaid River of St. John. 
<P>Secondly--The Government of East Florida. bounded to the Westward by the 
Gulph of Mexico and the Apalachicola River; to the Northward by a Line drawn 
from that part of the said River where the Chatahouchee and Flint Rivers meet, 
to the source of St. Mary's River. and by the course of the said River to the 
Atlantic Ocean; and to the Eastward and Southward by the Atlantic Ocean and the 
Gulph of Florida, including all Islands within Six Leagues of the Sea Coast. 
<P>Thirdly--The Government of West Florida. bounded to the Southward by the 
Gulph of Mexico. including all Islands within Six Leagues of the Coast. from the 
River Apalachicola to Lake Pontchartrain; to the Westward by the said Lake, the 
Lake Maurepas, and the River Mississippi; to the Northward by a Line drawn due 
East from that part of the River Mississippi which lies in 31 Degrees North 
Latitude. to the River Apalachicola or Chatahouchee; and to the Eastward by the 
said River. 
<P>Fourthly--The Government of Grenada, comprehending the Island of that name, 
together with the Grenadines, and the Islands of Dominico, St. Vincent's and 
Tobago. And to the end that the open and free Fishery of our Subjects may be 
extended to and carried on upon the Coast of Labrador, and the adjacent Islands. 
We have thought fit. with the advice of our said Privy Council to put all that 
Coast, from the River St. John's to Hudson's Streights, together with the 
Islands of Anticosti and Madelaine, and all other smaller Islands Iying upon the 
said Coast, under the care and Inspection of our Governor of Newfoundland. 
<P>We have also, with the advice of our Privy Council. thought fit to annex the 
Islands of St. John's and Cape Breton, or Isle Royale, with the lesser Islands 
adjacent thereto, to our Government of Nova Scotia. 
<P>We have also, with the advice of our Privy Council aforesaid, annexed to our 
Province of Georgia all the Lands Iying between the Rivers Alatamaha and St. 
Mary's. 
<P>And whereas it will greatly contribute to the speedy settling of our said new 
Governments, that our loving Subjects should be infomed of our Paternal care, 
for the security of the Liberties and Properties of those who are and shall 
become Inhabitants thereof, We have thought fit to publish and declare, by this 
Our Proclamation, that We have, in the Letters Patent under our Great Seal of 
Great Britain, by which the said Governments are constituted. given express 
Power and Direction to our Governors of our Said Colonies respectively, that so 
soon as the state and circumstances of the said Colonies will admit thereof, 
they shall, with the Advice and Consent of the Members of our Council, summon 
and call General Assemblies within the said Governments respectively, in such 
Manner and Form as is used and directed in those Colonies and Provinces in 
America which are under our immediate Government: And We have also given Power 
to the said Governors, with the consent of our Said Councils, and the 
Representatives of the People so to be summoned as aforesaid, to make, 
constitute, and ordain Laws. Statutes, and Ordinances for the Public Peace, 
Welfare, and good Government of our said Colonies, and of the People and 
Inhabitants thereof, as near as may be agreeable to the Laws of England, and 
under such Regulations and Restrictions as are used in other Colonies; and in 
the mean Time, and until such Assemblies can be called as aforesaid, all Persons 
Inhabiting in or resorting to our Said Colonies may confide in our Royal 
Protection for the Enjoyment of the Benefit of the Laws of our Realm of England; 
for which Purpose We have given Power under our Great Seal to the Governors of 
our said Colonies respectively to erect and constitute, with the Advice of our 
said Councils respectively, Courts of Judicature and public Justice within our 
Said Colonies for hearing and determining all Causes, as well Criminal as Civil, 
according to Law and Equity, and as near as may be agreeable to the Laws of 
England, with Liberty to all Persons who may think themselves aggrieved by the 
Sentences of such Courts, in all Civil Cases. to appeal, under the usual 
Limitations and Restrictions, to Us in our Privy Council. 
<P>We have also thought fit, with the advice of our Privy Council as aforesaid, 
to give unto the Governors and Councils of our said Three new Colonies, upon the 
Continent full Power and Authority to settle and agree with the Inhabitants of 
our said new Colonies or with any other Persons who shall resort thereto, for 
such Lands. Tenements and Hereditaments, as are now or hereafter shall be in our 
Power to dispose of; and them to grant to any such Person or Persons upon such 
Terms, and under such moderate Quit-Rents, Services and Acknowledgments, as have 
been appointed and settled in our other Colonies, and under such other 
Conditions as shall appear to us to be necessary and expedient for the Advantage 
of the Grantees, and the Improvement and settlement of our said Colonies. 
<P>And Whereas, We are desirous, upon all occasions, to testify our Royal Sense 
and Approbation of the Conduct and bravery of the Officers and Soldiers of our 
Armies, and to reward the same, We do hereby command and impower our Governors 
of our said Three new Colonies, and all other our Governors of our several 
Provinces on the Continent of North America, to grant without Fee or Reward, to 
such reduced Officers as have served in North America during the late War, and 
to such Private Soldiers as have been or shall be disbanded in America, and are 
actually residing there, and shall personally apply for the same, the following 
Quantities of Lands, subject, at the Expiration of Ten Years, to the same 
Quit-Rents as other Lands are subject to in the Province within which they are 
granted, as also subject to the same Conditions of Cultivation and Improvement; 
viz. 
<P>To every Person having the Rank of a Field Officer--5,000 Acres. 
<P>To every Captain--3,000 Acres. 
<P>To every Subaltern or Staff Officer,--2,000 Acres. 
<P>To every Non-Commission Officer,--200 Acres . 
<P>To every Private Man--50 Acres. 
<P>We do likewise authorize and require the Governors and Commanders in Chief of 
all our said Colonies upon the Continent of North America to grant the like 
Quantities of Land, and upon the same conditions, to such reduced Officers of 
our Navy of like Rank as served on board our Ships of War in North America at 
the times of the Reduction of Louisbourg and Quebec in the late War, and who 
shall personally apply to our respective Governors for such Grants. 
<P>And whereas it is just and reasonable, and essential to our Interest, and the 
Security of our Colonies, that the several Nations or Tribes of Indians with 
whom We are connected, and who live under our Protection, should not be molested 
or disturbed in the Possession of such Parts of Our Dominions and Territories 
as, not having been ceded to or purchased by Us, are reserved to them. or any of 
them, as their Hunting Grounds.--We do therefore, with the Advice of our Privy 
Council, declare it to be our Royal Will and Pleasure. that no Governor or 
Commander in Chief in any of our Colonies of Quebec, East Florida. or West 
Florida, do presume, upon any Pretence whatever, to grant Warrants of Survey, or 
pass any Patents for Lands beyond the Bounds of their respective Governments. as 
described in their Commissions: as also that no Governor or Commander in Chief 
in any of our other Colonies or Plantations in America do presume for the 
present, and until our further Pleasure be known, to grant Warrants of Survey, 
or pass Patents for any Lands beyond the Heads or Sources of any of the Rivers 
which fall into the Atlantic Ocean from the West and North West, or upon any 
Lands whatever, which, not having been ceded to or purchased by Us as aforesaid, 
are reserved to the said Indians, or any of them. 
<P>And We do further declare it to be Our Royal Will and Pleasure, for the 
present as aforesaid, to reserve under our Sovereignty, Protection, and 
Dominion, for the use of the said Indians, all the Lands and Territories not 
included within the Limits of Our said Three new Governments, or within the 
Limits of the Territory granted to the Hudson's Bay Company, as also all the 
Lands and Territories lying to the Westward of the Sources of the Rivers which 
fall into the Sea from the West and North West as aforesaid. 
<P>And We do hereby strictly forbid, on Pain of our Displeasure, all our loving 
Subjects from making any Purchases or Settlements whatever, or taking Possession 
of any of the Lands above reserved. without our especial leave and Licence for 
that Purpose first obtained. 
<P>And. We do further strictly enjoin and require all Persons whatever who have 
either wilfully or inadvertently seated themselves upon any Lands within the 
Countries above described. or upon any other Lands which, not having been ceded 
to or purchased by Us, are still reserved to the said Indians as aforesaid, 
forthwith to remove themselves from such Settlements. 
<P>And whereas great Frauds and Abuses have been committed in purchasing Lands 
of the Indians, to the great Prejudice of our Interests. and to the great 
Dissatisfaction of the said Indians: In order, therefore, to prevent such 
Irregularities for the future, and to the end that the Indians may be convinced 
of our Justice and determined Resolution to remove all reasonable Cause of 
Discontent, We do. with the Advice of our Privy Council strictly enjoin and 
require. that no private Person do presume to make any purchase from the said 
Indians of any Lands reserved to the said Indians, within those parts of our 
Colonies where, We have thought proper to allow Settlement: but that. if at any 
Time any of the Said Indians should be inclined to dispose of the said Lands, 
the same shall be Purchased only for Us, in our Name, at some public Meeting or 
Assembly of the said Indians, to be held for that Purpose by the Governor or 
Commander in Chief of our Colony respectively within which they shall lie: and 
in case they shall lie within the limits of any Proprietary Government. they 
shall be purchased only for the Use and in the name of such Proprietaries, 
conformable to such Directions and Instructions as We or they shall think proper 
to give for that Purpose: And we do. by the Advice of our Privy Council, declare 
and enjoin, that the Trade with the said Indians shall be free and open to all 
our Subjects whatever. provided that every Person who may incline to Trade with 
the said Indians do take out a Licence for carrying on such Trade from the 
Governor or Commander in Chief of any of our Colonies respectively where such 
Person shall reside. and also give Security to observe such Regulations as We 
shall at any Time think fit. by ourselves or by our Commissaries to be appointed 
for this Purpose, to direct and appoint for the Benefit of the said Trade: 
<P>And we do hereby authorize, enjoin, and require the Governors and Commanders 
in Chief of all our Colonies respectively, as well those under Our immediate 
Government as those under the Government and Direction of Proprietaries, to 
grant such Licences without Fee or Reward, taking especial Care to insert 
therein a Condition, that such Licence shall be void, and the Security forfeited 
in case the Person to whom the same is granted shall refuse or neglect to 
observe such Regulations as We shall think proper to prescribc as aforesaid. 
<P>And we do further expressly conjoin and require all Officers whatever, as 
well Military as those Employed in the Management and Direction of Indian 
Affairs, within the Territories reserved as aforesaid for the use of the said 
Indians, to seize and apprehend all Persons whatever. who standing charged with 
Treason. Misprisions of Treason. Murders, or other Felonies or Misdemeanors. 
shall fly from Justice and take Refuge in the said Territory. and to send them 
under a proper guard to the Colony where the Crime was committed of which they, 
stand accused. in order to take their Trial for the same. 
<P>Given at our Court at St. James's the 7th Day of October 1763. in the Third 
Year of our Reign.
