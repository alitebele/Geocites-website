<H1>A Royal Canadian Air Cadet Site on the Web</H1></CENTER><FONT size=2>Here is 
some interesting information.
<P>Royal Canadian Air Cadets was formed in 1942 to train young men in avaition 
in preparation for the war. After the war, the aim was changed to these three:
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>To promote in youth the attributes of citizenship and leadership 
qualities.
  <P></P>
  <LI>To promote physical fitness.
  <P></P>
  <LI>To stimulate in youth an interest in the Air element of the Canadian 
  forces.
  <P></P></LI></OL>Royal Canadian Air Cadets are not a part of the Military. We 
are supported by DND(Department of National Defense) and the Air Cadet League of 
Canada. DND supplies Training and Supplies to the squadrons and they also train 
the officers which are in charge of the squadrons. Air Cadet League of Canada 
supply the Administration part of the program. Also the League provides 
scholarships for the Air Cadets.
<P>In 1976, girls were permitted to enter Cadets. A squadron is a group of Air 
Cadets. I am currently part of 521 Aurora Squadron in Mission, B.C.. Canada has 
around 400 squadrons.
<P>The Air Cadet program consists of a five year program: 
<UL>
  <LI>The first year is used to introduce the cadet to the Air Cadet program. At 
  the end of the first year cadets are allowed to go to a summer camp. the usual 
  camp is Basic. A two weel summer camp which prepares the cadet for the next 
  level of training. 
  <LI>In the second year the cadet is introduced to more aviation topics, 
  Leadership and Citzenship. After this year cadets have a varity of summer 
  camps which they can apply for. 
  <LI>The Third year and Fourth year is spent in advanced Aviation topics and 
  Leadership. When cadets reach this level they are learning how to teach and 
  have a leadership role in the squadron. In this year Cadets are able to apply 
  for scholarship summer camps. 
  <LI>The Fifth year is used to prepare cadets to take command of the squadron. 
  The training is geared towards the Warrent Officer positions in the squadron. 
  The cadets are instructing and leading. Apply for advanced summer camps 
  (Flying Scholarships) 
  <LI>The sixth and seventh year is instructing cadets and leading the squadron 
  as Squadron Commander, Deputy-Commander or Flight Commanders. These cadets 
  apply for staff positions at summer camps. </LI></UL>Come back later for more 
information on Air Cadets.
